# FizzBuzzJazzFuzz

## 1. FizzBuzz
Simple C# solution for fizz buzz game from 1 to 100, printing the results in console.

## 2. FizzBuzz and JazzFuzz
FizzBuzzJazzBuzz implementation that uses factory pattern, that makes this code more robust, less coupled and easier to extend. Solution includes the fizz buzz game from 1 to 100, and jazz fuzz game that goes from 100 to 1. Solution has separated write line to console in another class, which makes the solution easier to further implement as GUI application or save the results as a file.

## Comments
I wasn't sure to include this in the solution, but the idea was to one for loop to create a list or string, and FizzBazz and JazzFuzz should only be responsible for replacing the list or string with correct words. This would make the code even more easier to implement new solutions, but i believe it would increase the time complexity of the algoritms.
